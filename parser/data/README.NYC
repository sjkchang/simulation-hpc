# NYC Open Data Project

There is a wealth of free data from New York City that you can use for testing,  

https://data.cityofnewyork.us

The NYC traffic ticket data provides an opportunity to look at dense data set of 
small record size. This contrasts with large data records such as imagery or
binary data.

The data is raw, direct from the city of New York. With raw data there are quality
and noise within the data set. You will need to take this into account while working
with the data.
